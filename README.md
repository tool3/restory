# restory 2.0

âœ… Rewritten in TypeScript.  
âœ… Added quiet mode.  
âœ… super fast (uses git-filter-repo instead of git filter branch).  
âœ… simple and intuitive api.  
âœ… standalone - no 3rd party requirements (git-filter-repo included).

> [!CAUTION]
> THIS WILL REWRITE YOUR GIT HISTORY!  
> THIS OPERATION CANNOT BE REVERTED!  
> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# install

```bash
npm install -g @tool3/restory
```

or

```bash
npx @tool3/restory <cmd> [args] [options]
```

things to know:

- `restory` uses it's own dist of [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo)  
  and therefore doesn't rely on you having it.
- by default it does **NOT** remove `origin` when done rewriting. (unless run with `--safe`).
- every `restory` command recreates the commit|s shas.
- you need to have a clean working directory.
- you will have to force push if using the same `origin`.
- when run without commit filter flag (`-s` || `-n` || `-r` - see [options](#options)) - the command will rewrite **ALL** commits with given input.

# api

every command in `restory` can either set a new value or replace an existing value.  
`restory <cmd> [optional-subject-to-replace] <value>`
